WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager, possibly rendering your system unusable. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv. Use the --root-user-action option if you know what you are doing and want to suppress this warning.

[notice] A new release of pip is available: 25.3 -> 26.0
[notice] To update, run: python3.12 -m pip install --upgrade pip
